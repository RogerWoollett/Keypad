# Keypad
This is a Python/tkinter keypad that can be used to get values from a user.
Should work with python 2 or 3.
It can be configured for size, integer/decimal, signed/unsigned.
Put both files in the same directory and run Trypad.py to test. See the comments in both files for more information.
The Key class has now been modified to make it more generally useful.
